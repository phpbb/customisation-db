Creating a new type is a pretty simple process.

Type files are stored in two locations:
	includes/types/ This is the main PHP configuration file for the type
	language/en/types/ This is the language file for the type

To create a new type it is recommended that you copy one of the existing types
	and rename all the required things in it to fit the new type you wish to create.

Information for the type configuration file:
	Create a new ID for the type (this must be unique).  For your own custom types
		you should start with 10 to leave room in case additional types are added
		to the core.
	public $id = 10;
	
	After selecting an ID you should update the constant defined at the top of the file
		with the id you selected:
	define('TITANIA_TYPE_TEST', 10);
	
	Select the URL part that will be used for these types:
	public $url = 'test';
	
	After selecting the URL part to use, update the .htaccess file to include it in
		the list of allowed types:
	(mod|style|converter|official_tool|bridge|test|contributions?)
	
	For more information and more available settings open the includes/types/base.php
		file and look at the titania_type_base class near the bottom with some short
		explainations on what most are for.  Most configurations are already used in
		different ways in the included types as well, so you may look at them for reference.

For any permissions that were added in the auto_install function you must also add them
	in the permissions language file within phpBB's language directory.  Either make
	your own language file (recommended to prevent problems when updating) or update
	the language/en/acp/permissions_titania.php file.

NOTE:
	Files in the includes/types/ directory that begin with _ are not loaded automatically,
		either you must rename them (not recommended in case of issues when updating), or
		create a file with the same name minus the beginning underscore that includes it,
		or create a symlink without the underscore to the file.
