Creating a new hook file allows you to quite easily extend and modify Titania without
	having to perform file edits.

Hook files are located in includes/hooks/

The hooks system is almost identical to the phpBB hooks system, but includes some additional
	features to make using them easier.

You can register hooks by a call like this:
	titania::$hook->register_ary('my_hook_', array(
		'titania_page_header',
	));

Upon calling of the titania_page_header hook in code, the hooks system would then attempt
	to call the my_hook_titania_page_header function with the my_hook_ being the prefix declared
	when setting it up.

Beyond this you will need to look at examples, look at the design/info documentation for the
	phpBB3 hooks system, or look into the hooks system itself.  The biggest difference is in
	that a new call type is used primarily, call_hook_ref, which uses the first item as a
	referenced variable allowing you to make modifications to the data within it.

NOTES:
	Files in the includes/hooks/ directory that begin with _ are not loaded automatically,
		either you must rename them (not recommended in case of issues when updating), or
		create a file with the same name minus the beginning underscore that includes it,
		or create a symlink without the underscore to the file.

	As with the phpBB3 hooks system, the first variable sent to the called function is always
		the hook object itself.  Additional variables sent to the function will come in order
		after that.
