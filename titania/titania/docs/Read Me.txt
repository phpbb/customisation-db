Some basic information/things to keep in mind about Titania:

After each new release of phpBB you need to perform a few actions:
	1. Upload the properly named package (ex: phpBB-3.0.7-PL1.zip for 3.0.7-pl1) to includes/phpbb_packages
	2. Update the phpbb_versions information in the config.php file to contain the latest version for the updated phpBB branch

After each new release of ModX you need to perform an action:
	Upload the properly named xsl file (ex: 1.2.5.xsl for ModX 1.2.5) to download/modx/

For the Styles Demo board:
	If not installing on the main board, it must be on the same server, on a different database, and with the same database prefix
		as the main board uses (limitation of current code using table constants).

For Solr Search:
	For the longer search queries used in Find Contribution you may need to raise the limit on Jetty
	(using the Solr example path)
	
	Open:
	etc/jetty.xml
	
	In each set of:
	<Call name="addConnector">
	
	Add with the other <set> calls (may need to adjust this depending upon just how large you expect it to be, 8096 works for sorting up to about 500 contributions):
	<Set name='headerBufferSize'>8096</Set>
