// DEVELOPERS PLEASE NOTE
//
// All language files should use UTF-8 as their encoding and the files must not contain a BOM.
//
// Placeholders can now contain order information, e.g. instead of
// 'Page %s of %s' you can (and should) write 'Page %1$s of %2$s', this allows
// translators to re-order the output of data while ensuring it remains correct
//
// You do not need this where single placeholders are used, e.g. 'Message %d' is fine
// equally where a string contains only two placeholders which are used to wrap text
// in a url you again do not need to specify an order e.g., 'Click %sHERE%s' is fine
// Some characters you may want to copy&paste:
// ’ » “ ” …

While the support Team of phpBB.com does their best to assist you in running and using your forum they can not, and are not expected to, provide support for any customisation/contribution.  It is the hope of phpBB that the author of the contribution provide you, the end user, with support in using their customisation.  Please remember that all authors are volunteers who have spent their time in providing an enhancement to the phpBB software.  The saying “You get more flies with honey than you do with vinegar” applies, so please keep this in mind when requesting support for a customisation (eg, be nice in the way you ask).'

This support can range anywhere from assisting you to getting the customisation installed and may even provide to you additional add-ons to enhance the customisation.  To access this area you simply click on the customisation and a tab will be displayed stating “Discussion/Support”.  Once you access this area you may post a question or comment to the author.  Please remember that authors are under no obligation to provide support just as they are under no obligation to provide to you the customisation.  If you run across a post or comment that you feel is not in the best interests of the community, please feel free to use the “Report this post” button and a moderator will take the appropriate action necessary.'
